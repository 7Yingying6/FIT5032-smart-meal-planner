# Smart Meal Planner

A small Vue 3 app I put together for planning weeknight meals, browsing recipes, and turning the plan into a clean shopping list. Built with Vite, designed to be fast and easy to use on both desktop and mobile.

## What it does

- Browse recipes and filter by category, time, and difficulty
- Plan the week and see a quick summary of your meals
- Auto-generate a shopping list from the plan (with search, sort, and pagination)
- Rate recipes and keep simple stats
- Sign in/out with basic roles (for coursework)

## Tech

- Vue 3 + Vite
- Vue Router 4
- Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome
- Firebase Auth (optional/demo)

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit
http://localhost:5173
```

## Pages

- Home: overview and shortcuts
- Recipes: browse and filter
- Recipe Detail: stats, ratings, and content
- Meal Plan: weekly plan + shopping list
- Auth: sign in/register (demo accounts)

## Notes

This repo was organized for FIT5032 coursework. It is intentionally simple and not production-hardened. If you spot anything that could be cleaner, feel free to improve it.
